Investigation Notes: Model Deployment and Usage Issues

1. Backend Implementation Issues (text_clustering.py):
- get_cluster_summary() is incomplete (just returns first text)
- Model parameters may need optimization:
  * KMeans: Only using random_state
  * Agglomerative: No distance metric specified
  * DBSCAN: Fixed eps and min_samples might not work for all cases
- TF-IDF parameters might need tuning for Chinese text

2. API Implementation Issues (clustering.py router):
- Using external services for model management
- Need to verify error handling for clustering requests
- Need to check model configuration for Chinese text

3. Deployment Configuration Status:
- Verified Dockerfile configuration is correct:
  * Using poetry run with uvicorn directly
  * Command: ["poetry", "run", "uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
  * Poetry virtualenvs.create false for proper environment setup
  * Dependencies properly installed in container
- No changes needed to deployment configuration
- Previous FastAPI CLI error resolved by existing poetry setup

4. Chinese Text Processing Issues:
- TF-IDF vectorizer using English stop words
- No specific Chinese text tokenization
- Parameters may need adjustment for Chinese language characteristics

5. Model Selection and Usage:
- Models defined but may not be properly initialized
- Need to verify model endpoint accessibility
- Clustering parameters may need optimization for Chinese text
- No specific handling for Chinese text characteristics

Next Steps:
1. Add Chinese text processing support (jieba integration)
2. Optimize clustering parameters for Chinese text
3. Improve cluster summary generation
